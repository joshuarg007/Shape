# Shape
  The "Shape" project involves creating an abstract class in Java named "Shape," featuring abstract methods for calculating surface area and volume. Subsequently, subclasses "Sphere," "Cylinder," and "Cone" extend the "Shape" class, each implementing methods to compute and display their respective surface areas and volumes based on specified parameters. The driver class "ShapeArray" instantiates objects of these subclasses, stores them in an array, and prints out their instance data using the "toString" method. The submission includes a zipped folder containing condensed source files and a Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram, emphasizing version control through GIT repositories for each assignment.
